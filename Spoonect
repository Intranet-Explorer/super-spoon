Certainly! Here's a PowerShell script that prompts for a computer name and then runs the specified `netsh` commands on that computer remotely:

```powershell
# Prompt for computer name
$computerName = Read-Host "Enter the computer name"

# Check if the computer is reachable
if (Test-Connection -ComputerName $computerName -Count 1 -Quiet) {
    # Run the commands remotely
    $showProfileCmd = Invoke-Command -ComputerName $computerName -ScriptBlock {
        netsh wlan show profile
    }

    $showMainprodCmd = Invoke-Command -ComputerName $computerName -ScriptBlock {
        netsh wlan show profile mainprod
    }

    # Display the output
    Write-Output "Output for 'netsh wlan show profile':"
    Write-Output $showProfileCmd

    Write-Output "`nOutput for 'netsh wlan show profile mainprod':"
    Write-Output $showMainprodCmd
}
else {
    Write-Error "Failed to reach $computerName. Please ensure the computer is online and accessible."
}
```

For this script to work:

1. Both the local computer (from where you run the script) and the target computer must have PowerShell remoting enabled (usually through `Enable-PSRemoting`).
2. You must have the appropriate permissions to connect and execute commands on the remote computer.
3. Adjustments might be required for environments with special configurations or restrictions.
